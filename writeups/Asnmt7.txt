Theory:
1. Overview of Ethereum Private Blockchain:

An Ethereum private blockchain is a completely isolated blockchain network that is accessible only to a predefined group of participants. Unlike the public Ethereum network, which is open to everyone, a private blockchain is suitable for testing, development, and specific enterprise use cases where privacy, security, and control are critical.

2. Use Cases for Private Blockchains:

Testing and Development: Private blockchains offer a sandbox environment for developers to test smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and network configurations without using real Ether or exposing the work to the public Ethereum network.
Enterprise Solutions: Many businesses leverage private blockchains to deploy internal applications, maintain control over transaction data, and secure confidential information.
Customizable: Private blockchains allow developers to adjust block time, gas limits, and mining difficulty, making them more flexible and efficient for specific use cases.
3. Geth (Go Ethereum):

Geth is the official Ethereum client written in Go language. It allows users to run a full Ethereum node, interact with smart contracts, and explore blockchain functionalities. It is widely used for both public and private Ethereum networks.
