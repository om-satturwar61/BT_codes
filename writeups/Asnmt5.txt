Crowdfunding Overview:

Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds for a project or business venture by collecting small contributions from a large number of people, typically via the internet. A blockchain-based crowdfunding platform ensures transparency, as all transactions are visible on the public ledger, and smart contracts can be programmed to release funds only when certain conditions are met.

2. Benefits of Blockchain in Crowdfunding:

Transparency: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full visibility.
Automation: Smart contracts automate the release of funds when predefined conditions are met.
Trustless: No need for intermediaries as the contract itself enforces rules.
Security: Funds are securely held within the contract and can only be accessed under specific conditions.
3. Key Components of a Crowdfunding Smart Contract:

Project Creator: The person or entity that initiates the crowdfunding campaign.
Contributors: Individuals who contribute Ether (ETH) to the project.
Goal: The target amount of Ether that needs to be raised for the project.
Deadline: The time limit for raising the required funds.
Refund Mechanism: If the goal is not met by the deadline, contributors can get their funds back.
