Decentralized Lottery Overview:

A decentralized lottery is a lottery system that operates entirely on the blockchain, without requiring a centralized authority to manage it. Participants can enter the lottery by sending a specific amount of cryptocurrency (e.g., Ether) to the smart contract, and after a specified period or number of participants, a winner is randomly selected. The winner receives the accumulated Ether as a prize, making the process trustless, transparent, and secure.

2. Key Features of a Decentralized Lottery:

Entry Mechanism: Users participate in the lottery by sending Ether to the smart contract.
Random Winner Selection: A winner is randomly selected from the pool of participants using blockchain data (e.g., block hash or timestamp).
Prize Distribution: The smart contract automatically sends the prize (collected Ether) to the winnerâ€™s wallet.
Decentralization: The entire process is automated by the smart contract without human intervention or intermediaries.
3. Key Solidity Concepts:

Payable Functions: Functions that allow the contract to receive Ether.
Randomness: Solidity provides limited options for randomness, usually based on block properties (e.g., block.timestamp, block.difficulty).
Visibility Modifiers: To protect functions from being accessed in unintended ways.
State Variables: To track participants and manage the lottery state.
