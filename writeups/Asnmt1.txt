Theory:
1. Remix IDE Installation:

Remix IDE is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) used for developing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts. It supports the Solidity language and offers an in-browser editor, a file explorer, and a compiler.
Steps to install and set up Remix IDE:
Open your web browser.
Navigate to the Remix IDE website (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
No additional installation is required; the IDE can be used directly in the browser.
Optional: Install Remix IDE as a desktop app using Electron.
2. Solidity Constructs Overview:

Functions: Reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks. Functions in Solidity can be declared as public, private, internal, or external.

Visibility and Activity Qualifiers:

Visibility defines who can access a function or variable.
public, private, internal, external are the four types of visibility.
Activity qualifiers like view, pure, and payable control state modification and payment reception.
Address and Address Payable:

address: Holds 20-byte Ethereum addresses.
address payable: Allows Ether transactions.
Bytes and Enums:

bytes: Dynamic arrays of bytes.
enum: A user-defined data type consisting of a set of named values.
Arrays:

Fixed Arrays: Predefined size arrays (e.g., uint[5]).
Dynamic Arrays: Arrays without a fixed size.
Special Arrays (bytes and string):

bytes: Dynamically sized byte array.
string: A dynamically sized string.
Struct: Allows defining custom data types by grouping variables together.

Mapping: A key-value data structure in Solidity.

Inheritance: Enables contracts to inherit properties and methods from parent contracts.

Error Handling: Mechanisms to handle and manage errors (e.g., require, assert, revert).
